What is a Hypergraph? What is Hypergraph Partitioning?
-----------
Hypergraphs are a generalization of graphs, where each (hyper)edge (also called net) can
connect more than two vertices. The *k*-way hypergraph partitioning problem is the generalization of the well-known graph partitioning problem: partition the vertex set into *k* disjoint
blocks of bounded size (at most 1 + ε times the average block size), while minimizing an
objective function defined on the nets.

The two most prominent objective functions are the cut-net and the connectivity (or λ − 1)
metrics. Cut-net is a straightforward generalization of the edge-cut objective in graph partitioning
(i.e., minimizing the sum of the weights of those nets that connect more than one block). The
connectivity metric additionally takes into account the actual number λ of blocks connected by a
net. By summing the (λ − 1)-values of all nets, one accurately models the total communication
volume of parallel sparse matrix-vector multiplication and once more gets a metric that reverts
to edge-cut for plain graphs.

What is Mt-KaHyPar?
-----------
Mt-KaHyPar is a shared-memory multilevel hypergraph partitioning framework
for optimizing the (λ − 1)-metric.
As a multilevel algorithm, it consist of three phases: In the *coarsening phase*, the
hypergraph is coarsened to obtain a hierarchy of smaller hypergraphs. After applying an
*initial partitioning* algorithm to the smallest hypergraph in the second phase, coarsening is
undone and, at each level, several *local search* methods are used to improve the partition induced by
the coarser level. Additionally, we use a hypergraph clustering algorithm as preprocessing
to restrict contractions to densely coupled regions during coarsening.

The Mt-KaHyPar framework provides two hypergraph partitioners:

- **Mt-KaHyPar Fast**: A scalable hypergraph partitioner that computes good partitions very fast
- **Mt-KaHyPar Strong**: A scalable hypergraph partitioner that computes high-quality partitions

Requirements
-----------

The Multi-Threaded Karlsruhe Hypergraph Partitioning Framework requires:

  - A 64-bit Linux operating system.
  - A modern, ![C++17](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-17-blue.svg?style=flat)-ready compiler such as `g++` version 7 or higher or `clang` version 11.0.3 or higher.
 - The [cmake][cmake] build system (>= 3.16).
 - The [Boost - Program Options][Boost.Program_options] library and the boost header files (>= 1.48).
 - The [Intel Thread Building Blocks][tbb] library (TBB)
 - The [Portable Hardware Locality][hwloc] library (hwloc)

The following command will install most of the required dependencies on a Ubuntu machine:

    sudo apt-get install libboost-program-options-dev libnuma-dev numactl libhwloc-dev moreutils linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic libtbb-dev

Building Mt-KaHyPar
-----------

1. Clone the repository including submodules:

   ```git clone --depth=1 --recursive git@github.com:kahypar/mt-kahypar.git```
2. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Run cmake: `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE`
4. Run make: `make MtKaHyPar -j`

The build produces two executables, which will be located in `build/mt-kahypar/application/`:

- `MtKaHyParFast`: computes good partitions very fast
- `MtKaHyParStrong`: computes high-quality partitions in reasonable time (using n levels)

Running Mt-KaHyPar
-----------

Mt-KaHyPar has several configuration parameters. We recommend to use our presets which are located in the `config` folder:

- `default_preset.ini`: default parameters for Mt-KaHyPar Fast (`MtKaHyParFast`)
- `speed_deterministic_preset.ini`: parameters to make Mt-KaHyPar Fast (`MtKaHyParFast`) deterministic
- `quality_preset.ini`: default parameters for Mt-KaHyPar Strong (`MtKaHyParStrong`)

Deterministic mode is only supported for Mt-KaHyPar Fast, not Strong.
If you want to change parameters manually, please run `./MtKaHyParFast --help` or `./MtKaHyParStrong --help` for a detailed description of the different program options. We use the [hMetis format](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/fetch/sw/hmetis/manual.pdf) for the input hypergraph file as well as the partition output file.

To run Mt-KaHyPar Fast, you can use the following command:

    ./MtKaHyParFast -h <path-to-hgr> -p <path to default_preset.ini> -t <# threads> -k <# blocks> -e <imbalance (e.g. 0.03)> -o km1 -m direct

To run Mt-KaHyPar Strong, you can use the following command:

    ./MtKaHyParStrong -h <path-to-hgr> -p <path to quality_preset.ini> -t <# threads> -k <# blocks> -e <imbalance (e.g. 0.03)> -o km1 -m direct

The partition output file will be placed in the same folder as the input hypergraph file. If you want to change the default partition output folder, add the command line parameter `--partition-output-folder=path/to/folder`. There is also an option to disable writing the partition file `--write-partition-file=false`. Further, there are several useful options that can provide you with additional insights during and after the partitioning process:
- `--show-detailed-timings=true`: Shows detailed subtimings of each multilevel phase at the end of the partitioning process
- `--show-memory-consumption=true`: Gives detailed information on how much memory was allocated and how memory is reused throughout the algorithm
- `--enable-progress-bar=true`: Shows a progess bar during the coarsening and refinement phase

Mt-KaHyPar uses 32-bit vertex and hyperedge IDs. If you want to partition hypergraphs with more than 4.294.967.295 vertices or hyperedges, add option `-DKAHYPAR_USE_64_BIT_IDS=ON` to the `cmake` build command.

Scalability of Mt-KaHyPar
-----------
To evaluate speedups of Mt-KaHyPar, we use a benchmark set consisting of 94 large hypergraphs (see [Benchmark Statistics][SetB]). In the plot below, we summarize the speedups of Mt-KaHyPar Fast and Strong with p = {4,16,64} threads and k = {2,8,16,64} blocks.
We represent the speedup of each instance as a point and the cumulative harmonic mean speedup over all instances with a single-threaded running time >= x
seconds with a line.

The overall harmonic mean speedup of Mt-KaHyPar Fast is 3.4 for p = 4, 10.8 for p = 16 and 18.4 for p = 64. If we only consider instances with a
single-threaded running time >= 100s, we achieve a harmonic mean speedup of 23.5 for p = 64.

The overall harmonic mean speedup of Mt-KaHyPar Strong is 3.7 for p = 4, 11.7 for p = 16 and 22.6 for p = 64. If we only consider instances with a
single-threaded running time >= 100s, we achieve a harmonic mean speedup of 25 for p = 64.

Quality of Mt-KaHyPar
-----------

We use [*performance profiles*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s101070100263) to compare Mt-KaHyPar Fast and Strong to other partitioning algorithms in terms of solution quality (for a detailed explanation see either linked paper or our publications).

To compare with different sequential hypergraph partitioners, we use a benchmark set consisting of 488 hypergraphs (see [Benchmark Statistics][SetA], refered to as set A). In the figures, we compare Mt-KaHyPar Fast and Strong with the sequential hypergraph partitioners
PaToH in quality (PaToH-Q) and default preset (PaToH-D), the recursive bipartitioning variant (hMetis-R) of hMETIS and
KaHyPar-CA (similiar algorithmic components as Mt-KaHyPar Strong) and KaHyPar-HFC (extends KaHyPar-CA with flow-based refinement) of the
[KaHyPar](https://kahypar.org/) framework. On the same benchmark set on which we performed our scalability experiments
with 94 large hypergraph (see [Benchmark Statistics][SetB], refered to as set B), we compare ourselves with the distributed hypergraph partitioner Zoltan and the default preset of PaToH.

Comparing the sequential hypergraph partitioners with Mt-KaHyPar Fast and Strong (using 10 threads) on set A:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9654047/105867822-cb74fc80-5ff5-11eb-8ae1-9bf92257ab9f.png" alt="alt text" width="100%" height="100%">

Mt-KaHyPar Strong produces partitions with comparable quality to the sequential high-quality hypergraph partitioners hMetis-R and KaHyPar-CA, while being a factor of 30 resp. 8 faster on average (see running time plot below). Mt-KaHyPar Fast produces partitions with comparable quality to the quality preset of PaToH with a running time comparable to the default preset of PaToH. Mt-KaHyPar Strong computes significantly better partitions than Mt-KaHyPar Fast. The sequential high-quality hypergraph partitioner KaHyPar-HFC still computes better partitions than Mt-KaHyPar Fast and Strong. However, KaHyPar-HFC is on average 15 times
slower than Mt-KaHyPar Strong and 42 times slower than Mt-KaHyPar Fast.

Comparing the parallel hypergraph partitioners with Mt-KaHyPar Fast and Strong (using 64 threads) on set B:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9654047/105871387-88b52380-5ff9-11eb-934b-b32004988525.png" alt="alt text" width="66%">

Mt-KaHyPar Fast produces significantly better partitions than the distributed hypergraph partitioner Zoltan, while also being a factor of 2.5 faster. Mt-KaHyPar Strong computes significantly better partitions than Mt-KaHyPar Fast, while being a factor of 6 slower.

Comparing the running time of all evaluated partitioners on set A (left) and set B (right):

Note that increasing number of threads does not negatively affect solution quality of Mt-KaHyPar Fast and Strong.

Using the Library Interfaces
-----------

We provide a simple C-style interface to use Mt-KaHyPar as a library.  The library can be built and installed via

```sh
make install.mtkahypar # use sudo to install system-wide
```

and can be used like this:

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

#include <libkahypar.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

  // Initialize thread pool with 8 threads and NUMA allocation policy INTERLEAVED
  mt_kahypar_initialize_thread_pool(8, true /* activate interleaved NUMA allocation policy */ );

  // Load context from file
  mt_kahypar_context_t* context = mt_kahypar_context_new();
  mt_kahypar_configure_context_from_file(context, "path/to/config/file");

  // Setup Hypergraph
  const mt_kahypar_hypernode_id_t num_vertices = 7;
  const mt_kahypar_hyperedge_id_t num_hyperedges = 4;

  std::unique_ptr<mt_kahypar_hyperedge_weight_t[]> hyperedge_weights =
    std::make_unique<mt_kahypar_hyperedge_weight_t[]>(4);

  // force the cut to contain hyperedge 0 and 2
  hyperedge_weights[0] = 1;  hyperedge_weights[1] = 1000;
  hyperedge_weights[2] = 1;  hyperedge_weights[3] = 1000;

  std::unique_ptr<size_t[]> hyperedge_indices = std::make_unique<size_t[]>(5);

  hyperedge_indices[0] = 0; hyperedge_indices[1] = 2;
  hyperedge_indices[2] = 6; hyperedge_indices[3] = 9;
  hyperedge_indices[4] = 12;

  std::unique_ptr<mt_kahypar_hyperedge_id_t[]> hyperedges = std::make_unique<mt_kahypar_hyperedge_id_t[]>(12);

  // hypergraph from hMetis manual page 14
  hyperedges[0] = 0;  hyperedges[1] = 2;
  hyperedges[2] = 0;  hyperedges[3] = 1;
  hyperedges[4] = 3;  hyperedges[5] = 4;
  hyperedges[6] = 3;  hyperedges[7] = 4;
  hyperedges[8] = 6;  hyperedges[9] = 2;
  hyperedges[10] = 5; hyperedges[11] = 6;

  const double imbalance = 0.03;
  const mt_kahypar_partition_id_t k = 2;

  mt_kahypar_hyperedge_weight_t objective = 0;

  std::vector<mt_kahypar_partition_id_t> partition(num_vertices, -1);

  // Partition Hypergraph
  mt_kahypar_partition(num_vertices, num_hyperedges,
       	               imbalance, k, 0 /* seed */,
               	       nullptr /* unit vertex_weights */, hyperedge_weights.get(),
               	       hyperedge_indices.get(), hyperedges.get(),
       	               &objective, context, partition.data(),
                       false /* verbose output */ );

  // Print objective and block of each vertex
  std::cout << "Objective: " << objective << std::endl;
  for ( int i = 0; i != num_vertices; ++i ) {
    std::cout << "Vertex " << i << " = " << partition[i] << std::endl;
  }

  mt_kahypar_context_free(context);
}
```

If you want to load a hypergraph from a file, you can use the following code snippet:

```cpp
mt_kahypar_hypernode_id_t num_vertices = 0;
mt_kahypar_hyperedge_id_t num_hyperedges = 0;
size_t* hyperedge_indices(nullptr);
mt_kahypar_hyperedge_id_t* hyperedges(nullptr);
mt_kahypar_hypernode_weight_t* hypernode_weights(nullptr);
mt_kahypar_hyperedge_weight_t* hyperedge_weights(nullptr);
mt_kahypar_read_hypergraph_from_file("path/to/hypergraph/file", &num_vertices, &num_hyperedges,
  &hyperedge_indices, &hyperedges, &hyperedge_weights, &hypernode_weights);
```
